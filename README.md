# Polyn

Polyn is a dead simple service framework designed to be language agnostic while
and providing a simple, yet powerful, abstraction layer for building reactive events
based services.

According to [Jonas Boner](http://jonasboner.com/), reactive Microservices require you to:
1. Follow the principle “do one thing, and one thing well” in defining service boundaries
2. Isolate the services
3. Ensure services act autonomously
4. Embrace asynchronous message passing 
5. Stay mobile, but addressable 
6. Design for the required level of consistency

It is the aim of Polyn to provide for this in a consistent way.
